## Objective
Diabetes affects almost 40 million people in the US alone. A good predictive model based on patient demographics can help doctors and patients with early intervention and preventative treatments. 

## Data
Data was retrieved from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julnazz/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) and came with 3 datasets; 2 unbalanced and 1 balanced. The balanced one was chosen to optimize for model accuracy. 

## Methods
A database was created in SQL which was then conected to a pytho notebook using SQLalchemy. Using numpy, pandas, and seaborn, the data was assessed and visualized. Next, a tensorflow model was created to predict outcome of Diabetes.  

## Results
The final predictive model scored an accuracy of 75% on the testing data.
